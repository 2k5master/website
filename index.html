    <h2>OOTP HTML 2 CSV CONVERTER</h2>
    <p>Using the Python BeautifulSoup4 library, I made a tool to convert Out of The Park Baseball's html files, and extract a table from it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The tool will then analyze the stats and it will look for undervalued players. You can also input a college draft class and it will give you a recommened targets list.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>NFL 2k5 Draft Class Generator</h2>
    <p>This tool is a simple command line application that will fix NFL 2k5's draft class issues.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can choose to remove unique names or not--it's totally up to you.</p>
